# Snake-Game-in-Python
Built using Python &amp; turtle module. Features: snake movement, randomized food, score tracking, collision detection, and restart functionality. Perfect for learning OOP and game development!
🐍 Classic Snake Game in Python
This is a fully functional Snake Game built using Python and the turtle module. The game features classic Snake gameplay with modern touches, including randomized food spawning, score tracking, and collision detection.

🎮 Features:
Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).

Randomized Food: Food appears at random locations on the screen.

Score Tracking: A scoreboard keeps track of your progress in real-time.

Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or itself.

Restart Functionality: Press "R" to restart the game at any time.

💻 Tech Stack:
Python: Core programming language.

Turtle Module: Used for rendering graphics and handling animations.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The game is structured using classes and objects for better organization and scalability.
